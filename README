This is PSF reconstruction code for JWST NIRCam image with

Installation:
python setup.py install

Usage:
There are mainly two method to get the PSF model:
def _Image2PSFmodel(fullfitsname,wdirs,NPCs,SNR_thresh=20,osam=1,stamp_size=80,magleft=-15.,magright=-12.):
    """
    select the PSF star candidates from a given fitsfile file

    Parameters:
    ----------
    fdirs: str
        the file path of the fitsfile
    fitsname: str
        the fitsfile name of the fits file
    wdirs: str
        the path to save the selected star stamps
    NPCs: int
        number of PCs, larger than 4 are reommended
    method: string
        reconstruction method used 'iSPCA', 'SPCA', 'EMPCA' or 'PCA'
    S2N: float
        signal to noise ratio threshold for the star images,which will used in PCs calculation
    stamp_size: int
        the pxiel size of the cutout star stamp images:stamp_size*stamp_size
    magleft: float
        a threshold to select the star images,which are defined log10(flux)
    magright: float
        a threshold to select the star images,which are defined log10(flux)

    Returns:
    ----------
    str:
        the file name of the PSF moddel file.

def _get_webPSF(PCfile,
              psfpos,
              Target_Ng):
    '''
    Using the calculated PCs to interpolate the PSF modeling

    parameters
    ----------
    PCfile: str
        the constructed PC file
    psfpos: np.ndarray
        the required psf pos which you want, pos can be a 2 dimentional array,such as psfpos[xpos][ypos]
    Target_Ng: int
          the required pixel size of psf stamp

    return
    ------
    np.ndarray:
        the interpolated PSF modeling image matrix using polynomials
    '''
The science image fits file should be prepared first,
There is an test file: jw02736001001_02105_00009_nrcalong_cal.fits in tests
There also is an usage example of HybPSF: HybPSF using example.html

Attentions: sextractor need to be installed on you platform
